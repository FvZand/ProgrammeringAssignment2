The functions cache the inverse of a matrix. The function makeCacheMatrix creates a special "Matrix" object that can cache its inverse.The function cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve from the cache.
